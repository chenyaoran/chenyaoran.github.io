Due to the variety of each strawberry (shape, size, and color) and occlusions of strawberries by leaves and stems, precisely locating each strawberry brings a great challenge to the vision system of picking robots. Several methods have been developed for localizing strawberries, based on the well-known Mask R-CNN network, which, however, are not efficient running on the picking robots. In this paper, we propose a simple and highly efficient framework for strawberry instance segmentation running on low-power devices for picking robots, termed StrawSeg. Instead of using the common paradigm of “detection-then-segment”, we directly segment each strawberry in a single-shot manner without relying on object detection. In our model, we design a novel feature aggregation network to merge features with different scales, which employs a pixel shuffle operation to increase the resolution and reduce the channels of features. Experiments on the open-source dataset StrawDI_Db1 demonstrate that our model can achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and inference speed on a low-power device.","tags":["Journal","Electronics"],"title":"Aerodynamic performance assessment of φ-type vertical axis wind turbine under pitch motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhihao Zhang","Limin Kuang","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Yongsheng Zhao","Yan Bao","Lei Duan","Jiahuang Tu","Yaoran Chen","Mingsheng Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"f747dfbf19952204657c509254f7ec54","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2023/018-2023-egy-zzh-hzl/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2023/018-2023-egy-zzh-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The winglet has been widely deployed in the optimization of the blade design as it reduces the tip loss of the blade and increases the swept area of the rotor.

The motivation is to extract the nonlinear dynamic characteristics and the hydrodynamic memory information through the advantage of CNN and LSTM, respectively. For the feature selection, the time histories of motion states and wave heights are selected to involve sufficient information. Taken a scaled KCS as the study object, the ship motions in sea state 7 irregular long-crested waves are simulated and used for the validation. The results show that at least one period of roll motion can be accurately predicted.

Hence, efficiency enhancement is an essential topic for the VAWT design. This paper attempts to propose an improved active control strategy and a novel blade structure with a trailing-edge flap for H-type VAWT to improve the power outputs at different tip speed ratios (TSRs). The orthogonal experiment design (OED) method was applied to optimize the motion of pitch and flap at low and moderate TSRs. Subsequently, the output characteristics, including the coefficients of power, torque, tangential force, and thrust of the optimized pitch-flap (P-F) model and three other models, namely the base model, the pitch-only (P-O) model, and the flap-only (F-O) model, were compared. Besides, the flow structures and static pressure distribution on the blade surface were studied to reveal the mechanism of power increase. It was found that the synergic motion of pitch and flap could effectively suppress the flow separation and delay the dynamic stall around blade. The result indicated that enhancement of the P-F model in torque coefficient was over 130% and 60% at low and moderate TSRs compared to the base model. In addition, the synergic motion of pitch and flap was found able to reduce the load fluctuation of the VAWT. The improved active control strategy and the blade structure with a trailing-edge flap may be helpful for the potential application of the H-type VAWT in offshore engineering.","tags":["Journal"],"title":"Aerodynamic performance optimization of vertical axis wind turbine with straight blades based on synergic control of pitch and flap","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaoran Chen","Dan Zhang","Xiaowei Li","Yan Peng","Chuhan Wu","Huayan Pu","Dai Zhou","Yong Cao","Jiujun Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1679702400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1679702400,"objectID":"a747941b5a393736b19a7c5aeaca11e1","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2023/016-2023-eai-cyr-zd/","publishdate":"2023-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2023/016-2023-eai-cyr-zd/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of significant wave height (SWH) is crucial for managing wave energy.

However, solid-solid triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) are not wear-resistant in corrosive environments. Therefore, to effectively harvest ocean energy over the long term, a novel solid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerator based on vortex-induced resonance (VIV-SL-TENG) is presented. The energy is harvested through the resonance between VIV of a cylinder and the relative motions of solid-liquid friction pairs inside the cylinder. The factors that affect the output performance of the system, including the liquid mass ratio and the deflection angle of the friction plates, are studied and optimized by establishing mathematical models and conducting computational fluid dynamics simulations. Furthermore, an experimental platform for the VIV-SL-TENG system is constructed to test and validate the performance of the harvester under different conditions. The experiments demonstrate that the energy harvester can successfully convert VIV energy into electrical energy and reach maximum output voltage in the resonance state. As a new type of energy harvester, the presented design shows a promising potential in the field of ‘blue energy’ harvesting.","tags":["Journal"],"title":"Solid-Liquid Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Vortex-Induced Resonance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaoran Chen","Dan Zhang","Xiaowei Li","Yan Peng","Chuhan Wu","Huayan Pu","Dai Zhou","Yong Cao","Jiujun Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1677196800,"objectID":"9dde8294530c28e34a62184341ee0dae","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2023/015-2023-oe-cyr-zd/","publishdate":"2023-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2023/015-2023-oe-cyr-zd/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of significant wave height (SWH) is crucial for managing wave energy.

However, the unsatisfactory power performance, mainly induced by the complex blade aerodynamics, restricts their development. Optimizing the turbine geometry is expected to improve the blade aerodynamics. In the present study, the effect of rotor solidity on the power performance and aerodynamics of VAWTs is systematically investigated using high-fidelity improved delayed detached-eddy simulations. A wide range of rotor solidity from 0.12 to 0.6 is studied for VAWTs with different numbers of blades, i.e., two- and three-bladed VAWTs. Also, different rotor diameters (0.5 m–2 m), covering VAWTs from domestic to building integration, are compared to explore the scale effect. In addition, the Reynolds number effect induced by the change of turbine geometry is considered and its impact on the solidity effect is elucidated. The results show that a low to moderate rotor solidity (e.g., lower than 0.3) allows the VAWT to achieve appreciable peak power performance. When the inflow velocity is fixed, for a given relatively low rotor solidity (e.g., 0.12), the two-bladed design is expected to achieve higher peak turbine power, while the three-bladed design is more advantageous when the rotor solidity is relatively high (e.g., 0.36). For a given rotor solidity, VAWTs with smaller rotor diameters perform relatively better due to the diminished tip loss effect. The effects of number of blades and rotor diameter are strongly affected by the variation of the chord-based Reynolds number. This study would support the optimal design of urban VAWTs.","tags":["Journal","Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics"],"title":"Aerodynamic performance assessment of φ-type vertical axis wind turbine under pitch motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaoran Chen","Limin Kuang","Jie Su","Dai Zhou","Yong Cao","Hao Chen","Zhaolong Han","Yongsheng Zhao","Shixiao Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1655424000,"objectID":"d6a8f2f18bcbc638e457503e1edfdb77","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2022/012-2022-oe-cyr-hzl/","publishdate":"2022-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2022/012-2022-oe-cyr-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The potential applications of twin vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in oceanic wind energy harvesting have drawn increasing attention. Previous researches have focused on the influence of relative location, rotational direction, tip speed ratio, etc. on the power output of this system.

In the current study, the methods of computational fluid dynamics are used to simulate the changes of power coefficients of the twin staggered H-rotors with their pitch angles. With a relative distance of 1.6 times diameter and a relative angle of 30 °, the rotors are operated at the optimal tip speed ratio in a co-rotating direction. Totally 49 cases are conducted to investigate the pitch angle range from −6° to 0° in both rotors. It is found that the changes in pitch angle of the target rotor will affect the performance of itself and the other rotor with fixed pitch angle. Within the specified pitch range, due to the influence of the other rotor, the largest difference in power performance reaches 4.79% for the upstream rotor, and 7.04% for the downstream one. In addition, the aerodynamic mechanism is comprehensively analysed through the comparisons among velocity, vorticity and pressure fields.

Also, the six degrees of freedom motions of the platforms not only can change the aerodynamics of the offshore floating wind turbines, but also may influence the wake interference between them. In the present study, the effect of the platform pitch motion on the wake interference between two tandem offshore floating vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) is characterized using the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES). First, the power performance of the downstream turbine (VAWT Ⅱ) at different separation distances, 2D ≤ LS ≤ 10D, and tip speed ratios, 0.4 ≤ TSRⅡ ≤ 1.5, are analyzed, assuming that the upstream turbine (VAWT Ⅰ) is bottom-fixed and operates at an optimal TSRⅠ of 1.2. Then, the effects of the pitch amplitude, 5° ≤ APⅠ ≤ 15°, and pitch period, 2T Ⅰ ≤ TPⅠ ≤ 8T Ⅰ, on the wake interference are characterized by assuming that the platform pitch motion of VAWT Ⅰ follows a prescribed simple harmonic law. The results show that locating VAWT Ⅱ in the medium wake region of VAWT Ⅰ, e.g., LS = 6D, can appropriately balance the power performance and space cost of the bottom-fixed turbine array. Also, the platform pitch motion can reduce the mean velocity deficit in the core wake region of VAWT Ⅰ. The mean wake deficit reduction increases the averaged power coefficient of VAWT Ⅱ, e.g., up to 22.67% when LS = 6D, TSRⅡ = 1.2, APⅠ = 15°, and TPⅠ = 4T Ⅰ. In addition, relatively larger pitch amplitudes and smaller pitch periods will further alleviate the negative effect of the wake interference. This study may serve as a reference for designing offshore floating wind farms.","tags":["Journal","Energy Conversion and Management"],"title":"Aerodynamic performance assessment of φ-type vertical axis wind turbine under pitch motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhikun Dong","Yaoran Chen","Dai Zhou","Jie Su","Zhaolong Han","Yong Cao","Yan Bao","Feng Zhao","Rui Wang","Yongsheng Zhao","Yuwang Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1642377600,"objectID":"82c71ab3c1d2598d68ce8233c877d290","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2022/011-2022-egy-dzk-zd/","publishdate":"2022-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2022/011-2022-egy-dzk-zd/","section":"publication","summary":"Using the random forest (RF) algorithm, this study presented a key parameter to characterize the mean wake of H-rotor VAWTs while modelling the wake.

The results show that the enclosed type basic diffuser with curved inner surface can significantly improve the power performance of the VAWT at moderate and high TSRs. The aerodynamic loads on the blade are enlarged and present more fluctuations. The power coefficient of the VAWT at TSR = 1.5 is increased by 51.73% when L1/D = 2 and θ1 = 20°. The flange and ejector can further enhance the capability of the basic diffuser by increasing the pressure difference and stabilizing the flow field. It is concluded that the external diffuser system would have potential applications in specific urban areas.","tags":["Journal","Energy Conversion and Management"],"title":"Wind-capture-accelerate device for performance improvement of vertical-axis wind turbines: External diffuser system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaoran Chen","Zhikun Dong","Jie Su","Yan Wang","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Yongsheng Zhao","Yan Bao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630627200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1630627200,"objectID":"3aaa5c4e045ebee0bbfd8f7d172bc1c0","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2021/008-2021-ecm-cyr-hzl/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2021/008-2021-ecm-cyr-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The maximum lift-to-drag coefficient of an airfoil directly affects the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine. Machine learning methods are known for being really effective in helping to predict this parameter in a faster and more accurate way. So far, the majority of related studies have focused on the use of artificial neural networks to make this prediction, but this model has issues with its poor interpretation and the confidence level of its results was unclear. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed, involving the Gaussian process regression and a hybrid feature mining process. The aim is to use the new framework to evaluate the maximum lift-to-drag ratio of given airfoils under a turbulent flow condition, where the Reynolds number is around 100,000. The feature mining process here designed contains a hybrid feature pool that comprises various geometric characters, and a hybrid feature selector that can assist the prediction performance and make it better. Based on the airfoil dataset of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that contains a total of 1432 profiles, a comparative analysis was conducted. The results showed that the current framework can provide a more accurate estimate than parallel models in both single-point and interval aspects of view. Noticeably, the model reached an overall precision of 95.2% and 94.1% on training and testing sets, respectively. Moreover, the simplicity and the confidence reference from the model output were further illustrated with a case study, which also verified that how it can serve real engineering application.","tags":["Journal","Energy Conversion and Management"],"title":"Framework of airfoil max lift-to-drag ratio prediction using hybrid feature mining and Gaussian process regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jie Su","Yu Li","Yaoran Chen","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Yongsheng Zhao","Yan Bao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1623888000,"objectID":"2a1ef2b5778c32046ed47eaeef8f5676","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2021/007-2021-egy-sj-hzl/","publishdate":"2021-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2021/007-2021-egy-sj-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The floating vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is considered as a competitive device in the utilization of offshore wind energy. However, the platform pitch motion would affect its aerodynamic behavior. In this paper, the aerodynamic performance of a floating φ-type VAWT under pitch motion is investigated by using the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation SST k−ω turbulence model. After verifying the feasibility of the numerical model, the effects of pitch motion amplitude and period on the aerodynamic characteristics were evaluated, and the impacts of these observations were elucidated. The results showed that the averaged net power coefficient increment of about 1.5%–15% could be obtained under platform pitch motions, and the fluctuation of aerodynamic loads was found to increase. Besides, the pitch motion pattern could be regarded as the combination of surge and heave motions, which explained the similarity of their effects on the wind turbine aerodynamics. Furthermore, it was found that the frequency of the peak torque coefficient would change under different periods of pitch motion, which should be noticed in the design of floating wind turbine. Finally, it was concluded that the current study provided additional information about the effect of pitch motion on wind turbine aerodynamics.","tags":["Journal","Energy"],"title":"Aerodynamic performance assessment of φ-type vertical axis wind turbine under pitch motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaoran Chen","Zhikun Dong","Yan Wang","Jie Su","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Kai Zhang","Yongsheng Zhao","Yan Bao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1609632000,"objectID":"fc4c752e2c35dd79c1ff5fc29958c332","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2021/006-2021-ecm-cyr-hzl/","publishdate":"2021-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2021/006-2021-ecm-cyr-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate short-term wind speed prediction is of great significance for early warning and regulation of wind farms. At present, the scale of wind speed time-history data is increasing, and its time resolution is also becoming higher. Traditional machine learning models cannot effectively capture and utilize nonlinear features from the large scaled dataset and this, not only increases the difficulty of model building, but also reduces the prediction accuracy. To overcome such challenges, a machine learning based framework involving data-mining method was proposed in this paper. To begin with, a powerful signal decomposition technique (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) was used to divide the original wind sequence into several intrinsic mode functions to form a potential feature set. Then, a more appropriate sub-feature set together with the corresponding machine learning model were automatically generated through an iteration process. Such process was constructed through a coupled algorithm using the binary coded searching method known as the genetic algorithm and the advanced recurrent neural network with long short term memory unit. The analytical results show that, when compared with the traditional mainstream models, the strategy of using the sequences provided by the signal decomposition technology as the input features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. On the other hand, faced with the high-dimensional feature set generated from the big data, the selected sub-feature set can not only perform a large dimension reduction, but also further improve the prediction accuracy up to 28.33% in terms of different kinds of evaluation criteria. Therefore, there is a potential application of the proposed method on more accurate short-term wind speed prediction under a considerable dataset of wind history.","tags":["Journal","Energy Conversion and Management"],"title":"Short-term wind speed predicting framework based on EEMD-GA-LSTM method under large scaled wind history","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaoran Chen","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, to achieve a higher aerodynamic performance, the design of such turbine needs attentive optimization to fit the surrounding wind variation. In this paper, a performance optimization of the shape of ϕ-shape Darrieus wind turbine with a given range of inlet wind speed is carried out. By involving a heuristic search algorithm, Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMAES), into Double Multiple Streamtube model (DMST), three geometrical variables of the rotor: the equatorial radius (R), the ratio of radius over half-height (β) and the blade number (B) are modified according to the fitness function that was specially built to satisfy the inlet wind range requirements. Moreover, to validate the optimization output, a 3D CFD simulation is conducted as a comparison. The result shows that this program can present an entirely optimized model under the given range of inlet wind speed, with a 12.5% improved Cp at the optimal velocity compared with the baseline. Verification from CFD method shows a satisfactory agreement for the optimized model compared with the DMST output, indicating that this algorithm could provide a reliable reference for the shape selection of ϕ-shape Darrieus turbines under a certain inlet wind condition.","tags":["Journal","Renewable Energy"],"title":"A shape optimization of ϕ-shape Darrieus wind turbine under a given range of inlet wind speed","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jie Su","Yaoran Chen","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Yan Bao","Yongsheng Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1581897600,"objectID":"e6949235c88a1d3b9e0a3cdc3b95d3ad","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2020/004-2020-apen-sj-hzl/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2020/004-2020-apen-sj-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is regarded as an important device to utilize the renewable offshore wind energy to supplement the existing power systems. Hence, the demand for higher wind energy conversion makes the research focus on the blade optimization of wind turbines. This paper attempts to propose a novel VAWT structure with V-shaped blade to improve the power outputs at moderate tip speed ratios. The feasibility of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes SST turbulence model applied on the VAWT was verified against available experiments at first. Then a comprehensive investigation on the aerodynamic performance of such V-shaped VAWT was carried out using the SST k-model. The results indicated that the maximum enhancement in power coefficient obtained in the optimal V-shaped blade was about 24.1. In addition to the great improvement of the power efficiency, the V-shaped blade was proven to alleviate the damage caused by lateral loads to the wind turbine. Besides, the flow structures over the blade surface were studied to reveal the mechanism of dynamic stall with the reason of power increase explained. Moreover, it was found that the V-shaped blade could effectively suppress the flow separation and delay the dynamic stall in the middle of the blade, and the undesirable blade tip effect would not be more serious comparing to that of the conventional straight blade. It was finally concluded that the current work could be practically applied to the design and optimization of the VAWT blades.","tags":["Journal","Applied Energy"],"title":"Investigation of V-shaped blade for the performance improvement of vertical axis wind turbines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuhang Zhang","Rui Wang","Yaoran Chen","Yan Bao","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Huan Ping","Shixiao Fu","Yongsheng Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1579824000,"objectID":"0723b97c07a6d5d2b225e3623657f848","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2020/003-2020-aip-zyh-hzl/","publishdate":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2020/003-2020-aip-zyh-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The three-dimensional characteristics of the flow past four square cylinders in an in-line square configuration, with five spacing ratios ranging from 1.4 to 5, were studied in depth in this study.

The onset and evolution of various unstable modes were expounded in detail by means of three-dimensional vortices, energy curves, wake patterns, and force coefficients. At each spacing, the three-dimensional instability and the corresponding flow pattern were comprehensively analyzed to illustrate transitional features. Except for the existence of unstable mode A and mode B when spacing was considerably small and large, for most of the intermediate spacing ratios, the vortex structures were dominated by mode C instability, whose flow patterns all appeared as anti-phase synchronization. Through the evolution of flow patterns over time, the three-dimensional effects were already observed at a low Reynolds number of 150 because of the influence of the gap flow and the mutual interference of the wake. Under the transitional spacing for Re = 200, multiple modes were interfering fiercely with each other and appeared as chaotic states.

This study provides a numerical investigation on understanding the surface pressure distribution, flow characteristics and dynamic responses of a parked straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), which is helpful for its design. Together with the two-way coupling method between simulation platforms such as STAR-CCM+ and ABAQUS, the SST k-ω turbulence model is used to obtain the surface pressure and surrounding flow of the VAWT, and the finite element method is used to obtain the dynamic responses of its structural components. The results show that the contours of the pressure distribution on the windward surface of the VAWT are similar even under a few different conditions, and the deformation of the VAWT can lead to changes in surface pressure; the turbulent flow characteristics and the wake effect become more obvious as the wind velocity increases; the blades and support arms of the VAWT need to be reinforced during the design, and the effect of the parked condition on the dynamic responses of the VAWT can be neglected. The two-way coupling method as well as the numerical simulation results is expected to provide references for the design of VAWTs subjected to coming wind action.","tags":["Journal","Energy Science \u0026 Engineering"],"title":"Flow characteristics and dynamic responses of a parked straight‐bladed vertical axis wind turbine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

These two movements can not only affect the aerodynamic loads, but also may influence the wake characteristics of the wind turbines. In the present study, the computational fluid dynamics approach with the improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES) and the overset mesh are employed to investigate the wake characteristics of an H-rotor floating vertical axis wind turbine under the platform’s pitch and surge motions. The wake profiles and structures between pitch and non-pitch conditions, and surge and non-surge conditions are compared. Then, the wake characteristics under different pitching amplitudes and periods and different surging amplitudes and periods are investigated. It is shown that pitch motion can enlarge the peak values of wake deficits and shift the positions of the mainstream of the wake in the vertical direction. The amplitudes and periods of the ‘wake wave’ under different pitching amplitudes and periods show regular variations. A ‘Spindle’ -type of wake structure is formed in the wake region under a platform’s surge motion, and the strength and core zone of the ‘Spindle’ also regularly change with different surging amplitudes and periods. These changes cause wake profile’s diversity at certain motion stages for the same downwind distance under different periods and amplitudes of surge and pitch","tags":["Journal","Energy","尾流分析","海洋风机","垂直轴风机","单风机","CFD","尾流分析"],"title":"Investigation of wake characteristics for the offshore floating vertical axis wind turbines in pitch and surge motions of platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
