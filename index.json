This paper presents a novel data-driven methodology to provide a multi-step prediction of ship roll motions in high sea states. A hybrid neural network is proposed that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) in parallel. The motivation is to extract the nonlinear dynamic characteristics and the hydrodynamic memory information through the advantage of CNN and LSTM, respectively. For the feature selection, the time histories of motion states and wave heights are selected to involve sufficient information. Taken a scaled KCS as the study object, the ship motions in sea state 7 irregular long-crested waves are simulated and used for the validation. The results show that at least one period of roll motion can be accurately predicted. Compared with the single LSTM and CNN methods, the proposed method has better performance in predicting the amplitude of roll angles. Besides, the comparison results also demonstrate that selecting motion states and wave heights as feature space improves the prediction accuracy, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.","tags":["Journal"],"title":"A data driven method for multi-step prediction of ship roll motion in high sea states","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Li Xiaowei","Zhang Di","Zhang Dan","Li Zhongjie","Wu Hao","Zhou Yuan","Wang Biao","Guo Hengyu","Peng Yan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1677628800,"objectID":"22fea338f724c63b975572fe2c6dd678","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2023/nano13061036/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023/nano13061036/","section":"publication","summary":"Energy converters based on vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) have shown great potential for harvesting energy from low-velocity flows, which constitute a significant portion of ocean energy. However, solid-solid triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) are not wear-resistant in corrosive environments. Therefore, to effectively harvest ocean energy over the long term, a novel solid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerator based on vortex-induced resonance (VIV-SL-TENG) is presented. The energy is harvested through the resonance between VIV of a cylinder and the relative motions of solid-liquid friction pairs inside the cylinder. The factors that affect the output performance of the system, including the liquid mass ratio and the deflection angle of the friction plates, are studied and optimized by establishing mathematical models and conducting computational fluid dynamics simulations. Furthermore, an experimental platform for the VIV-SL-TENG system is constructed to test and validate the performance of the harvester under different conditions. The experiments demonstrate that the energy harvester can successfully convert VIV energy into electrical energy and reach maximum output voltage in the resonance state. As a new type of energy harvester, the presented design shows a promising potential in the field of ‘blue energy’ harvesting.","tags":["Journal"],"title":"Solid-Liquid Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Vortex-Induced Resonance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["陈耀然","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
