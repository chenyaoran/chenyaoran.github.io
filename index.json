The objective of this study is to propose a novel bent winglet structure for wind turbines to improve performance under both stationary and surge conditions. To achieve this, the NREL Phase VI horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) is treated as a baseline. The numerical method employed is validated by comparing the simulated power and pressure coefficients of the HAWT with experimental data from the literature. The performance of the conventional winglet with the proposed novel winglet is compared in detail, taking into account the cant, twist, expansion direction, length, and winglet number of the conventional winglet. The results show that the novel bent winglet exhibits superior performance, with a 14.5% improvement in performance compared to the conventional winglet under surge motion.

For the USVs, collision avoidance (CA) trajectories need to be planned according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGS). A novel trajectory planning approach is proposed for the collision-free trajectories planning of USVs in the case of multiship encounters. Unlike the existing trajectory planning approaches, the proposed approach uses the holistic thinking to simplify the analysis of encounter situations. Ships approaching from all sides of the USV are treated as one or two equivalent obstacles based on consistent offset velocity direction (COVD) method. Furthermore, planned velocity is designed using the proposed CA strategy and kinematic constraints. This strategy is compliant with COLREGS and includes an emergency CA module to further ensure a safe distance between the USV and traffic ships. The performance of the proposed trajectory planning approach is verified through physical simulations using an existing simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed trajectory planning approach can implement multiple USVs to simultaneously avoid collisions and reach their respective target positions.

The traditional time-length-velocity (TVL) approach is severely dependent on the determination of the TVL factors and the selection of single-point measurement tap. To overcome the difficulties, this study aims to generate a generalized model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct the super-resolution pressure distributions from low-resolution pressure measurements at different wind directions. The constraint represented by the pressure gradient are embedded in the loss function of the CNN to enable the model to generate real pressure distribution characteristics. By spatially averaging the super-resolution distributions, the peak space-averaged pressure on the glazed panels could be finally predicted. On the basis of a rectangle-section high-rise building, the regions near the top corner and near the middle-height under different wind directions are focused on. Results show that the pressure peaks computed from the super-resolution distributions can provide more accurate and robust representations for the true area-averaged peaks, compared with the traditional TVL method. The generalization ability of the pressure gradient guided SRCNN is systematically investigated among different pressure modes and flow patterns influenced by the incident angles.

While the staggered arrangement shows promise for mitigating this interference, the understanding of the impact of vertically staggered setup remains ambiguous, especially in the case of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs). Also, the difference between horizontally and vertically staggered arrangements needs to be clarified. This study aims to shed light on these ambiguities, systematically evaluating the effectiveness of vertically staggered arrangement in mitigating wake interference between offshore VAWTs. High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to investigate the wake interference between two vertically staggered MW-class VAWTs. Typical separation distances (3D ≤ LS ≤ 7D) and different vertically staggered distances (−0.25H ≤ LV ≤ 0.75H) are considered, where D and H denote the turbine diameter and blade span length, respectively. Employing the Taguchi method, the effectiveness of horizontally and vertically staggered arrangements is compared, and the relatively optimal layout of the turbine array is identified. The results show that the vertically staggered arrangement significantly improves the power performance of the downstream turbine, e.g., the power output increases by 75.96% when LS = 7D and LV = 0.25H. When dealing with smaller LS (e.g., 3D), a negative LV is suggested, which reduces the tower cost while preserving the performance improvement. The vertically staggered arrangement has a greater impact on wake interference than the horizontally staggered arrangement. In terms of the relatively optimal layout, the power output of the turbine array is increased by 46.27%. These findings would contribute to the layout design of offshore wind farms.","tags":["VAWT","CFD"],"title":"Strategy for mitigating wake interference between offshore vertical-axis wind turbines: Evaluation of vertically staggered arrangement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Wu","Xingang Xu","Chuanfu Xin","Yichen Liu","Runze Rao","Zhongjie Li","Dan Zhang","Yongxi Wu","Senze Han"],"categories":["中科院一区","Expert Systems with Applications"],"content":"docker run -itd –name zhongbaoqi –gpus all –restart=always –shm-size 16G -p 9020:22 -v /mnt/sdc/docker-data/zhongbaoqi:/root caicandong/anaconda-pytorch:py38\n","date":1694736e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1694736e3,"objectID":"ac14fbfe7c3fc3255938090c26c6ac29","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/team/2023/2023_wh_xax_esa/","publishdate":"2023-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/team/2023/2023_wh_xax_esa/","section":"publication","summary":"Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provide a new approach to converting mechanical energy into electric power. Although many researchers have made progress in the improvement of the electric output of TENG, the service life of the electronic components in TENG is generally shorter than that of the stator or rotor windings in conventional generators. Considering that the fault of electronic components in TENG results in a decline in the electric output, which may subsequently increase the usage cost and even endanger the users of the TENG-based self-power devices. Thus, it is necessary to provide parametric schemes for the high-reliable iterative optimization design of TENG by identifying the fault-susceptible components in TENG. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework based on an attention neural network (AttCNN) for the fault diagnosis of TENG. The proposed method integrates the attention mechanism and convolutional network. Therein, the global correlation features in voltage signals extracted by the attention mechanism can effectively reflect the status variation of TENG among different moments, and the feature information extracted by the convolutional network guarantees the fault diagnosis efficiency of TENG. Thereby the proposed method fills in the gaps in the field of fault diagnosis for TENG. In the case study, the fault diagnosis performance of the proposed method for an experimental TENG is analyzed. The results indicate that the predicted and real status of TENG are in good agreement, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method for the fault diagnosis of TENG. Moreover, the results reveal that the proposed method possesses a promising generalization performance, demonstrating the feasibility of the application of the proposed method for the real-time fault diagnosis of TENG. A comparative analysis illustrates that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of recently published data-driven methods in terms of fault diagnosis accuracy and efficiency. Hence, the results of the case study indicate that the proposed method has the characteristic of high efficiency, high accuracy, and well-generalization, thereby the application of the proposed method is conducive to the safe operation of TENG.","tags":["Journal","Machine Learning"],"title":"Intelligent fault diagnosis for triboelectric nanogenerators via a novel deep learning framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cao Leilei","Yaoran Chen","Jin Qiangguo"],"categories":["中科院四区","Electronics"],"content":"","date":1689811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1689811200,"objectID":"6ca4633bb75ff96a8941915780d964bc","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2023/019_2023-electronics-cll-jqg/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2023/019_2023-electronics-cll-jqg/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine vision plays a great role in localizing strawberries in a complex orchard or greenhouse for picking robots. Due to the variety of each strawberry (shape, size, and color) and occlusions of strawberries by leaves and stems, precisely locating each strawberry brings a great challenge to the vision system of picking robots. Several methods have been developed for localizing strawberries, based on the well-known Mask R-CNN network, which, however, are not efficient running on the picking robots. In this paper, we propose a simple and highly efficient framework for strawberry instance segmentation running on low-power devices for picking robots, termed StrawSeg. Instead of using the common paradigm of “detection-then-segment”, we directly segment each strawberry in a single-shot manner without relying on object detection. In our model, we design a novel feature aggregation network to merge features with different scales, which employs a pixel shuffle operation to increase the resolution and reduce the channels of features. Experiments on the open-source dataset StrawDI_Db1 demonstrate that our model can achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and inference speed on a low-power device.","tags":["Journal","Machine Learning","Robots","Computer Vision"],"title":"Lightweight Strawberry Instance Segmentation on Low-Power Devices for Picking Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhaolong Han","Hao Chen","Yaoran Chen","Jie Su","Dai Zhou","Hongbo Zhu","Tangbin Xia","Jiahuang Tu"],"categories":["中科院二区","Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments"],"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1685577600,"objectID":"4898ce391c66dbadc82282dde513018b","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2023/017-2023-seta-hzl-zd/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2023/017-2023-seta-hzl-zd/","section":"publication","summary":"Low power efficiency is a critical reason that restricts the potential application of the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) in offshore engineering. Hence, efficiency enhancement is an essential topic for the VAWT design. This paper attempts to propose an improved active control strategy and a novel blade structure with a trailing-edge flap for H-type VAWT to improve the power outputs at different tip speed ratios (TSRs). The orthogonal experiment design (OED) method was applied to optimize the motion of pitch and flap at low and moderate TSRs. Subsequently, the output characteristics, including the coefficients of power, torque, tangential force, and thrust of the optimized pitch-flap (P-F) model and three other models, namely the base model, the pitch-only (P-O) model, and the flap-only (F-O) model, were compared. Besides, the flow structures and static pressure distribution on the blade surface were studied to reveal the mechanism of power increase. It was found that the synergic motion of pitch and flap could effectively suppress the flow separation and delay the dynamic stall around blade. The result indicated that enhancement of the P-F model in torque coefficient was over 130% and 60% at low and moderate TSRs compared to the base model. In addition, the synergic motion of pitch and flap was found able to reduce the load fluctuation of the VAWT. The improved active control strategy and the blade structure with a trailing-edge flap may be helpful for the potential application of the H-type VAWT in offshore engineering.","tags":["Journal","CFD","VAWT"],"title":"Aerodynamic performance optimization of vertical axis wind turbine with straight blades based on synergic control of pitch and flap","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dan Zhang","Xi Zhou","Zi-Hao Wang","Yan Peng","Shao-Rong Xie"],"categories":["中科院一区","Ocean Engineering"],"content":"","date":1684108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1684108800,"objectID":"8b6fa91de9bf0a6e3a9be14a2b1c2326","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/team/2023/zhang2023114230/","publishdate":"2023-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/team/2023/zhang2023114230/","section":"publication","summary":"Ship roll motion in high sea states has large amplitudes and nonlinear dynamics, and its prediction is significant for operability, safety, and survivability.

However, the unsatisfactory power performance, mainly induced by the complex blade aerodynamics, restricts their development. Optimizing the turbine geometry is expected to improve the blade aerodynamics. In the present study, the effect of rotor solidity on the power performance and aerodynamics of VAWTs is systematically investigated using high-fidelity improved delayed detached-eddy simulations. A wide range of rotor solidity from 0.12 to 0.6 is studied for VAWTs with different numbers of blades, i.e., two- and three-bladed VAWTs. Also, different rotor diameters (0.5 m–2 m), covering VAWTs from domestic to building integration, are compared to explore the scale effect. In addition, the Reynolds number effect induced by the change of turbine geometry is considered and its impact on the solidity effect is elucidated. The results show that a low to moderate rotor solidity (e.g., lower than 0.3) allows the VAWT to achieve appreciable peak power performance. When the inflow velocity is fixed, for a given relatively low rotor solidity (e.g., 0.12), the two-bladed design is expected to achieve higher peak turbine power, while the three-bladed design is more advantageous when the rotor solidity is relatively high (e.g., 0.36). For a given rotor solidity, VAWTs with smaller rotor diameters perform relatively better due to the diminished tip loss effect. The effects of number of blades and rotor diameter are strongly affected by the variation of the chord-based Reynolds number. This study would support the optimal design of urban VAWTs.","tags":["Journal","VAWT","CFD"],"title":"Systematic investigation of effect of rotor solidity on vertical-axis wind turbines: Power performance and aerodynamics analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Wu","Yan Lin","Yongxi Wu"],"categories":["中科院一区","Ocean Engineering"],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"a0bf6dabbdc4311a5ed229ef086ecca2","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/team/2022/2022_wh_wh/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/team/2022/2022_wh_wh/","section":"publication","summary":"The Tension Leg Platform (TLP) is a hybrid, compliant platform designed to sustain springing and ringing responses that are correlated to short-period motion. Since the period of short-period motion is within the wave energy concentration region, TLPs may experience sensitive short-period motion, such as resonance and green water, that usually cause serious damage to TLPs. In this study, a precontrol methodology is presented as a solution to prevent TLP-sensitive short-period motion. By applying the precontrol methodology, the parameters of TLP can be predetermined, allowing TLP motion performance to meet the requirements of short-period motion before sensitive motions actually occur. For example, the damping coefficient should be less than 4.3, the tendons’ stiffness should be larger than 0.91 × 108, and the dimensionless draft should be less than 0.665. The development of a precontrol methodology is based on a solid theoretical foundation. First, a series of simple and high-fidelity numerical models are proposed to simulate the natural period of roll, natural period of heave, and green water height. Second, a constraint regime is generated based on the numerical models and the sensitive motion range of short-period motion. The constraint regime is divided into two parts: the control range (corresponding to sensitive short-period motion) and the feasible range (the complementary set of control ranges in the whole parameter constraint domain). Finally, TLP parameters are derived from the calculated feasible range. The precontrol methodology goes beyond the conventional approach of real-time control by changing the control from a remedial action to a preventive action.","tags":["Journal","TLP","Journal of Ocean Engineering and Science"],"title":"Precontrol of short-period motion for a Tension Leg Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Limin Kuang","Qi Lu","Xuan Huang","Leijian Song","Yaoran Chen","Jie Su","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Yongsheng Zhao","Yuwang Xu","Yijie Liu"],"categories":["中科院一区","Energy Conversion and Management"],"content":"","date":1659312e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1659312e3,"objectID":"6d83ca38ea5364ccca643e3f0323daf0","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2022/013-2022-ecm-klm-hzl/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2022/013-2022-ecm-klm-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The wake interference within the offshore wind farms, especially with the tandem arrangement scenario, affects the designed total power output. Also, the six degrees of freedom motions of the platforms not only can change the aerodynamics of the offshore floating wind turbines, but also may influence the wake interference between them. In the present study, the effect of the platform pitch motion on the wake interference between two tandem offshore floating vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) is characterized using the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES). First, the power performance of the downstream turbine (VAWT Ⅱ) at different separation distances, 2D ≤ LS ≤ 10D, and tip speed ratios, 0.4 ≤ TSRⅡ ≤ 1.5, are analyzed, assuming that the upstream turbine (VAWT Ⅰ) is bottom-fixed and operates at an optimal TSRⅠ of 1.2. Then, the effects of the pitch amplitude, 5° ≤ APⅠ ≤ 15°, and pitch period, 2T Ⅰ ≤ TPⅠ ≤ 8T Ⅰ, on the wake interference are characterized by assuming that the platform pitch motion of VAWT Ⅰ follows a prescribed simple harmonic law. The results show that locating VAWT Ⅱ in the medium wake region of VAWT Ⅰ, e.g., LS = 6D, can appropriately balance the power performance and space cost of the bottom-fixed turbine array. Also, the platform pitch motion can reduce the mean velocity deficit in the core wake region of VAWT Ⅰ. The mean wake deficit reduction increases the averaged power coefficient of VAWT Ⅱ, e.g., up to 22.67% when LS = 6D, TSRⅡ = 1.2, APⅠ = 15°, and TPⅠ = 4T Ⅰ. In addition, relatively larger pitch amplitudes and smaller pitch periods will further alleviate the negative effect of the wake interference. This study may serve as a reference for designing offshore floating wind farms.","tags":["Journal","VAWT"],"title":"Characterization of wake interference between two tandem offshore floating vertical-axis wind turbines: Effect of platform pitch motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huizi Chen","Huaichen Yan","Yueying Wang","Shaorong Xie","Dan Zhang"],"categories":["中科院一区","Ocean Engineering"],"content":"","date":1657843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657843200,"objectID":"e0b2de6c32f3bf356774750a36ef150d","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/team/2022/2022_chz_zd/","publishdate":"2022-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/team/2022/2022_chz_zd/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies close formation control problem with prescribed performance and time-varying state constraints for a group of 4-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) underactuated surface vehicles (USVs) subject to actuator faults, input saturation and input delay.

Previous researches have focused on the influence of relative location, rotational direction, tip speed ratio, etc. on the power output of this system. However, limited studies have been done to uncover the effect of pitch angles on their aerodynamic performance, especially under staggered arrangements where the blade-vortex interaction remarkably occurs. In the current study, the methods of computational fluid dynamics are used to simulate the changes of power coefficients of the twin staggered H-rotors with their pitch angles. With a relative distance of 1.6 times diameter and a relative angle of 30 °, the rotors are operated at the optimal tip speed ratio in a co-rotating direction. Totally 49 cases are conducted to investigate the pitch angle range from −6° to 0° in both rotors. It is found that the changes in pitch angle of the target rotor will affect the performance of itself and the other rotor with fixed pitch angle. Within the specified pitch range, due to the influence of the other rotor, the largest difference in power performance reaches 4.79% for the upstream rotor, and 7.04% for the downstream one. In addition, the aerodynamic mechanism is comprehensively analysed through the comparisons among velocity, vorticity and pressure fields.

The three-dimensional improved delayed detached-eddy simulation is employed to predict the aerodynamics. First, the power performance and aerodynamic loads of the VAWT equipped with different types of basic diffusers are compared at the optimal tip speed ratio (TSR) of 1.5.

Afterwards, the effects of the rear flange and anterior ejector on the behaviors of the basic diffuser are investigated, and the flow structures around the VAWT are analyzed. Finally, an application prospect evaluation of the system is conducted. The results show that the enclosed type basic diffuser with curved inner surface can significantly improve the power performance of the VAWT at moderate and high TSRs. The aerodynamic loads on the blade are enlarged and present more fluctuations. The power coefficient of the VAWT at TSR = 1.5 is increased by 51.73% when L1/D = 2 and θ1 = 20°.

The results showed that the current framework can provide a more accurate estimate than parallel models in both single-point and interval aspects of view. Noticeably, the model reached an overall precision of 95.2% and 94.1% on training and testing sets, respectively.

At present, the scale of wind speed time-history data is increasing, and its time resolution is also becoming higher. Traditional machine learning models cannot effectively capture and utilize nonlinear features from the large scaled dataset and this, not only increases the difficulty of model building, but also reduces the prediction accuracy. To overcome such challenges, a machine learning based framework involving data-mining method was proposed in this paper. To begin with, a powerful signal decomposition technique (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) was used to divide the original wind sequence into several intrinsic mode functions to form a potential feature set. Then, a more appropriate sub-feature set together with the corresponding machine learning model were automatically generated through an iteration process. Such process was constructed through a coupled algorithm using the binary coded searching method known as the genetic algorithm and the advanced recurrent neural network with long short term memory unit. The analytical results show that, when compared with the traditional mainstream models, the strategy of using the sequences provided by the signal decomposition technology as the input features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. On the other hand, faced with the high-dimensional feature set generated from the big data, the selected sub-feature set can not only perform a large dimension reduction, but also further improve the prediction accuracy up to 28.33% in terms of different kinds of evaluation criteria. Therefore, there is a potential application of the proposed method on more accurate short-term wind speed prediction under a considerable dataset of wind history.","tags":["Journal","Time Series","Machine Learning"],"title":"Short-term wind speed predicting framework based on EEMD-GA-LSTM method under large scaled wind history","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaoran Chen","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In this paper, a performance optimization of the shape of ϕ-shape Darrieus wind turbine with a given range of inlet wind speed is carried out. By involving a heuristic search algorithm, Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMAES), into Double Multiple Streamtube model (DMST), three geometrical variables of the rotor: the equatorial radius (R), the ratio of radius over half-height (β) and the blade number (B) are modified according to the fitness function that was specially built to satisfy the inlet wind range requirements. Moreover, to validate the optimization output, a 3D CFD simulation is conducted as a comparison. The result shows that this program can present an entirely optimized model under the given range of inlet wind speed, with a 12.5% improved Cp at the optimal velocity compared with the baseline. Verification from CFD method shows a satisfactory agreement for the optimized model compared with the DMST output, indicating that this algorithm could provide a reliable reference for the shape selection of ϕ-shape Darrieus turbines under a certain inlet wind condition.","tags":["Journal","CFD","VAWT"],"title":"A shape optimization of ϕ-shape Darrieus wind turbine under a given range of inlet wind speed","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jie Su","Yaoran Chen","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Yan Bao","Yongsheng Zhao"],"categories":["中科院一区","Applied Energy"],"content":"","date":1581724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1581724800,"objectID":"e6949235c88a1d3b9e0a3cdc3b95d3ad","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2020/004-2020-apen-sj-hzl/","publishdate":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2020/004-2020-apen-sj-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is regarded as an important device to utilize the renewable offshore wind energy to supplement the existing power systems. Hence, the demand for higher wind energy conversion makes the research focus on the blade optimization of wind turbines. This paper attempts to propose a novel VAWT structure with V-shaped blade to improve the power outputs at moderate tip speed ratios. The feasibility of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes SST turbulence model applied on the VAWT was verified against available experiments at first. Then a comprehensive investigation on the aerodynamic performance of such V-shaped VAWT was carried out using the SST k-model. The results indicated that the maximum enhancement in power coefficient obtained in the optimal V-shaped blade was about 24.1. In addition to the great improvement of the power efficiency, the V-shaped blade was proven to alleviate the damage caused by lateral loads to the wind turbine. Besides, the flow structures over the blade surface were studied to reveal the mechanism of dynamic stall with the reason of power increase explained. Moreover, it was found that the V-shaped blade could effectively suppress the flow separation and delay the dynamic stall in the middle of the blade, and the undesirable blade tip effect would not be more serious comparing to that of the conventional straight blade. It was finally concluded that the current work could be practically applied to the design and optimization of the VAWT blades.","tags":["Journal","CFD","VAWT"],"title":"Investigation of V-shaped blade for the performance improvement of vertical axis wind turbines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuhang Zhang","Rui Wang","Yaoran Chen","Yan Bao","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Huan Ping","Shixiao Fu","Yongsheng Zhao"],"categories":["中科院四区","AIP Advances"],"content":"","date":1579651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1579651200,"objectID":"0723b97c07a6d5d2b225e3623657f848","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2020/003-2020-aip-zyh-hzl/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2020/003-2020-aip-zyh-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"The three-dimensional characteristics of the flow past four square cylinders in an in-line square configuration, with five spacing ratios ranging from 1.4 to 5, were studied in depth in this study. Direct numerical simulation of the spectral/hp element method was employed at Re = 150 and 200. The onset and evolution of various unstable modes were expounded in detail by means of three-dimensional vortices, energy curves, wake patterns, and force coefficients. At each spacing, the three-dimensional instability and the corresponding flow pattern were comprehensively analyzed to illustrate transitional features. Except for the existence of unstable mode A and mode B when spacing was considerably small and large, for most of the intermediate spacing ratios, the vortex structures were dominated by mode C instability, whose flow patterns all appeared as anti-phase synchronization. Through the evolution of flow patterns over time, the three-dimensional effects were already observed at a low Reynolds number of 150 because of the influence of the gap flow and the mutual interference of the wake. Under the transitional spacing for Re = 200, multiple modes were interfering fiercely with each other and appeared as chaotic states. Compared with other bluff body forms, the four square cylinders generated numerous discrepancies and new modal transitions in three-dimensional cases.","tags":["Journal","CFD"],"title":"Three-dimensional wake transition in the flow over four square cylinders at low Reynolds numbers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Limin Kuang","Jie Su","Yaoran Chen","Zhaolong Han","Dai Zhou","Yongsheng Zhao","Zhiyu Jiang","Yan Bao"],"categories":["中科院三区","Energy Science Engineering"],"content":"","date":1569888e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1569888e3,"objectID":"e4d3423dca7a19a0a950dfec32e0199b","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/admin/2019/002-2019-ese-klm-hzl/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/admin/2019/002-2019-ese-klm-hzl/","section":"publication","summary":"With the development of urbanization and the application of renewable energy, wind turbine is becoming an important approach for wind energy reservation and utilization. This study provides a numerical investigation on understanding the surface pressure distribution, flow characteristics and dynamic responses of a parked straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), which is helpful for its design. Together with the two-way coupling method between simulation platforms such as STAR-CCM+ and ABAQUS, the SST k-ω turbulence model is used to obtain the surface pressure and surrounding flow of the VAWT, and the finite element method is used to obtain the dynamic responses of its structural components. The results show that the contours of the pressure distribution on the windward surface of the VAWT are similar even under a few different conditions, and the deformation of the VAWT can lead to changes in surface pressure; the turbulent flow characteristics and the wake effect become more obvious as the wind velocity increases; the blades and support arms of the VAWT need to be reinforced during the design, and the effect of the parked condition on the dynamic responses of the VAWT can be neglected. The two-way coupling method as well as the numerical simulation results is expected to provide references for the design of VAWTs subjected to coming wind action.","tags":["Journal","Energy Science \u0026 Engineering","VAWT","CFD"],"title":"Flow characteristics and dynamic responses of a parked straight‐bladed vertical axis wind turbine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

These two movements can not only affect the aerodynamic loads, but also may influence the wake characteristics of the wind turbines. In the present study, the computational fluid dynamics approach with the improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES) and the overset mesh are employed to investigate the wake characteristics of an H-rotor floating vertical axis wind turbine under the platform’s pitch and surge motions. The wake profiles and structures between pitch and non-pitch conditions, and surge and non-surge conditions are compared. Then, the wake characteristics under different pitching amplitudes and periods and different surging amplitudes and periods are investigated. It is shown that pitch motion can enlarge the peak values of wake deficits and shift the positions of the mainstream of the wake in the vertical direction. The amplitudes and periods of the ‘wake wave’ under different pitching amplitudes and periods show regular variations. A ‘Spindle’ -type of wake structure is formed in the wake region under a platform’s surge motion, and the strength and core zone of the ‘Spindle’ also regularly change with different surging amplitudes and periods. These changes cause wake profile’s diversity at certain motion stages for the same downwind distance under different periods and amplitudes of surge and pitch","tags":["Journal","VAWT","CFD"],"title":"Investigation of wake characteristics for the offshore floating vertical axis wind turbines in pitch and surge motions of platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
